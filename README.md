# normative_modelling

This repository hosts my work on applying normative modelling to brain and genetic data related to Autism Sprectrum Disorder. I have been working on people carrying ASD-related variants but not diagnosed with ASD in the context of my internship at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, supervised by Clara Moreau and Thomas Rolland.

All of my scripts are based on Saige Rutherford's original scripts which can be found on her own GitHub : https://github.com/saigerutherford/CPC_ML_tutorial

My internship report can also be found in this repositery.
