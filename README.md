# normative_modelling

This repository hosts my work on applying normative modelling to brain and genetic data related to Autism Sprectrum Disorder. I have been working on people carrying ASD-related variants but not diagnosed with ASD in the context of my internship at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, supervised by Clara Moreau and Thomas Rolland.
